# Machine-Failure-Prediction
->Basically this Machine learning model is created for the Cement company which we are considering as a nontechnical client. 
->They wanted us to make machine learning model which can predict their machine failure based on their previous Log-Data.  
->I cant desclose the real dataset here, I worked on Exploratory data analysis(EDA),Evaluation Methods, Data tranformation, Data Visualization, Feature encoding, Feature Selection, and different machine learning models.
->This data set is taken taken from kaggle.
->once a model got ready, I worked on deployment of the machine learning model through web application(Flask).
